  <!-- The first is the react package which is the API.  -->
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@17.0.1/umd/react.development.js"></script>

  <!--
    The second library is the rendering layer. Since this is a web app and we're rendering to the browser we need to use React DOM.
    There are other React libraries like React Native for example if we wanted to render things in a mobile application.
