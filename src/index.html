  <!-- 
    React is a JavaScript library.
    You can use as little or as much of React as you want. React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption.
  -->


  <!-- root is where the react app will be rendered -->
  <div id="root">not rendered</div>

  <!-- React is split into two parts.-->

  <!-- The first is the React library which is the API.  -->
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@17.0.1/umd/react.development.js"></script>

  <!--
    The second library is the rendering layer. Since this is a web app and we're rendering to the browser we need to use React DOM.
    There are other React libraries like React Native for example if we wanted to render things in a mobile application.
  -->
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@17.0.1/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>

  <script>
    // React createElement takes in three arguments. Type, props, and children.
    // The type argument can be either a tag name string like an h1, div, span, etc.
    // A React component or a React fragment.
    // A React fragment lets you return multiple elements in a render method without creating an additional DOM element.


    const App = () => React.createElement('h1', {}, 'This is a pure react app! :)');

    ReactDOM.render(React.createElement(App), document.getElementById('root'));
